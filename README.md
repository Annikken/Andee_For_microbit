# Andee for microbit
This is an Arduino Library that enables the microbit to use the Andee system on the Arduino IDE. All you need is the microbit board, the Arduino IDE and your phone with the Andee app installed to get a customised UI up and running;

## Installation
1. Make sure that the Arduino IDE can recognise your microbit board. If you have done this, go to step 2. If not, in the Arduino IDE, go to File -> Board -> Boards Manager. Search for "nordic" and the library "Nordic Semiconductor nRF5 Boards by Sandeep Mistry" and install the latest version. 

2. Next you will need to install the ArduinoBLE library. In the Arduino IDE, go to Sketch -> Include Library -> Manage Libraries. Search for "bleperipheral" and install the latest version.

3. Lastly you will need the Andee for microbit library. You can download the library by going to the library manager again and search for "Andee for microbit". Install the latest version and you should be ready.

You can also choose to download the library from our github page at https://github.com/Annikken/Andee_for_microbit. Click the green download button and click on Download Zip. Unzip the file to your Arduino library folder, which by default is located at C:\Users\YourUsername\Documents\Arduino.
